            Khan el-Khalili (Arabic: خان الخليلي) is a famous bazaar in the historic center of Cairo, Egypt.
             Established as a center of trade in the Mamluk era and named for one of its several historic caravanserais, the bazaar district has since become one of Cairo's main attractions for tourists and Egyptians alike.

           Pyramids are large, ancient structures with triangular outer surfaces that converge to a point at the top. The most famous are the Egyptian pyramids, which were primarily built as tombs for pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.
            The Great Pyramid of Giza, built for Pharaoh Khufu, is the largest of these, and it is the last remaining of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
